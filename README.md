## Creator Notes
* Creaing this game used my knowledge of object-orientated programming using `JavaScript`.
* Styling using `CSS`, with `font-awesome` emojis, and the Google font `Fredoka One` 
* As with any project of mine, when my skills increase, I will come back and make some improvements on the game.


## Installation 
* Download or clone the repository to your device
* Once you have unzipped the folder, open the `index.html` file to begin playing.


## How to play
1) Use your arrow keys to move the hero around the board
2) Avoid the overgrown bugs that even King Kong and Godzilla would be afraid of, or you die. 
3) You need to get to river at the top to win.
